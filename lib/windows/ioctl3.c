 *
 * Windows answers the same question differently.  NtQueryVolumeInformationFile
 * with FileFsDeviceInformation reports what kind of device is behind a handle,
 * and FILE_DEVICE_CONSOLE is 0x50.  Any other command has no counterpart and
 * fails, which is what ioctl does on Unix for a command a device does not
 * know.
