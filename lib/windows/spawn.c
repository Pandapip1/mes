/* Start a program, wait for it, and answer with what it exited with.
 *
 * The counterpart of lib/posix/spawn.c, which does this with fork, execve and
 * waitpid.  There is no fork here: Windows has RtlCloneUserProcess, and
 * lib/windows/fork.c does get a child out of it, but only on a real Windows
 * kernel and only by way of a 64-bit trampoline -- it is the most elaborate
 * thing in this directory and it is not what starting a program should
 * require.
 *
 * __spawn, which execve already stands on, starts the program directly; this
 * is execve without the _exit at the end, because a caller that wants to go
 * on running is the whole point.  See lib/windows/execve.c for how a child is
 * made and how argv survives being flattened into one command line.
 *
 * The status is the whole POSIX word, exit code in the second byte up, the
 * way waitpid here reports it.
