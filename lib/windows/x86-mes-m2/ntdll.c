/* What every other file in lib/windows/ stands on: how to reach an ntdll
 * routine, and how to hand it a filename.
 *
 * Windows has no syscall a program may make directly, so there is no
 * _sys_call here for lib/windows/ to be thin wrappers over the way
 * lib/linux/ is over int $0x80.  What there is instead, for most of this
 * file's own history, was this: lib/m2/x86/ntdll-i386.hex2 finds ntdll
 * through the PEB before main runs and resolves the routines this needs out
 * of its export table by name, into a table of addresses, and __ntdll hands
 * one back by index.
 *
 * Every caller below now reaches ntdll a different way instead:
 * __ntdll_resolve (name) walks this process's own PEB -> Ldr -> module list
 * and ntdll's own export table itself, in-process, and hands back the same
 * kind of address __ntdll (slot) did.  Ported from stage0-pe32's M2libc fork
 * (M2libc/x86/windows/ntdll.c), which measured it byte-identical to the
 * index table for every routine this port ever calls.  __ntdll (slot) and
 * lib/windows/x86-mes-m2/ntdll.h's NT_* constants stay in place below --
 * lib/m2/x86/ntdll-i386.hex2 still fills the same table for the
 * hand-assembled stages before this file's own C exists to call
 * __ntdll_resolve -- but nothing compiled from C in this port calls __ntdll
 * by slot any more.
 *
 * Either way, the call itself is through a function pointer, and three
 * things about that are not obvious and are not optional.
 *
 *   The arguments go in backwards.  M2-Planet pushes the first argument
 *   first, so it lands furthest from the stack pointer, and a stdcall callee
 *   wants the first argument nearest.  Every call below is written in reverse
 *   and carries a comment saying what it reads as forwards.
 *
 *   Nothing else has to be done about stdcall.  ntdll pops its own arguments,
 *   which would strand a caller that popped them again -- but M2-Planet saves
 *   the stack pointer before pushing and restores it from there afterwards,
 *   rather than adding back what it pushed.
 *
 *   No argument may touch EDX.  M2-Planet keeps the pointer it is about to
 *   call in EDX across the argument list and never puts it back, so an
 *   argument that writes EDX replaces the address about to be called and the
 *   program jumps to zero.  Three things write it: a function call; `*`, `/`
 *   or `%`, which compile to imul and idiv; and subscripting an array, which
 *   is a multiply by the element size even when the index is a constant.  So
 *   every argument below is a local or a constant, and anything computed is
 *   worked out into a local on the line before.
 *
 * The routine at each index is decided by lib/m2/x86/ntdll-i386.hex2, and
 * lib/windows/x86-mes-m2/ntdll.h names them.
 *
 * Filenames: ntdll takes UTF-16, inside an OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES around a
 * UNICODE_STRING, and for a file on disk it wants an NT path (\??\C:\...)
 * rather than the DOS path a program was given.
 * RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U does that conversion and __ntobject does the
 * rest.  Widening is a zero byte after each byte, which is right for ASCII
 * and wrong for everything else; a path with a character above 127 will not
 * survive, and this is not the layer that could say so.
 *
 * Nothing here frees anything.  Mes's malloc never gives memory back either.
