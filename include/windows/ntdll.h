/* The interface every file in lib/windows/ is written against, whichever
 * compiler is building it.  What cannot be said in C -- the PEB read, and
 * the slot table that only a hand-assembled stage has -- lives in
 * lib/windows/<arch>-mes-<compiler>/ntlow.c; everything else is here.
 *
 * Which ntdll routine lib/m2/x86/ntdll-i386.hex2 resolved into which slot.
 * The numbering is decided there and nowhere else, so this half is copied
 * from stage0-pe32 fcc842d (x86/M2libc-windows/ntdll-slots.h), which that
 * project generates from the same list it generates the .hex2 from.  If the
 * .hex2 beside it is updated, this must be too.
 *
 * Nothing compiled from C in this port calls __ntdll (slot) by one of these
 * any more -- see ntdll.c's own top-of-file comment for __ntdll_resolve,
 * which replaced it everywhere above the hand-assembled stages.  These
 * stay, because lib/m2/x86/ntdll-i386.hex2 still fills the same table for
 * those stages, which have no C compiler yet to call __ntdll_resolve with.
